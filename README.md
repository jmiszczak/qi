# QI

QI is a package for Mathematica computer algebra system developed to support symbolic analysis of quantum states and operations.

## Usage

Package funcionality is defined in `QI.m`, `QIExtras.m`, `QINisq`, and `QIWalks` files, whish should be placed in `Applications` subdirectory in `.Mathematica` directory (on Unix-based systems).

The main package can be loaded
```
<<QI`
```

Less common functionality is available in `QIExtras` package

```
<<QIExtras`
```

Functions relevant for NISQ computing are available in `QINisq` package.
```
<<QINisq`
```

Basic functionality for simulating unitary quantum walks is are available in `QIWalks` package.
```
<<QIWalks`
```

## Documentation

Documentation, including description of all functions, is available in `doc` subdirectory.
